          <pre>A final distinction separates contests into two types: 
               those that require at least a minimum of physical skill and those that do not.
               Shuffleboard is a good example of the first; the board games Scrabble and Monopoly 
               will do to exemplify the second. It must of course be understood that even the simplest 
               sports, such as weightlifting, require a modicum of intellectual effort,
